# Introduction to Calculus

Calculus is the mathematics of change. Let's explore its beauty!

## The Derivative

The derivative represents the **instantaneous rate of change** of a function.

For a function $f(x)$, the derivative is defined as:

$$
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}
$$

### Example: Power Rule

For $f(x) = x^2$, we can find the derivative:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}(x^2) = 2x
$$

This tells us that the slope of $x^2$ at any point $x$ is $2x$.

## The Integral

The integral represents the **accumulation** of a quantity.

$$
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx
$$

This gives us the area under the curve $f(x)$ from $a$ to $b$.

### Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

The fundamental theorem connects derivatives and integrals:

$$
\int_a^b f'(x) \, dx = f(b) - f(a)
$$

## Try It Yourself

Experiment with different functions and see how their derivatives behave!
